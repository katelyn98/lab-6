    "Your project for this week is to **write the documentation for your program**. You've written the jupyter notebook with the program last week, now you're going to supply the documenation for it, as if it was a real project.  So, beef up what you wrote last week! You choose what this project is; it can be anything you imagine, no matter how trivial or silly. Don't copy an existing project verbatim (that's plaigiarism, not to mention boring). \n",

Read over other READMEs to get an idea of what else you should include: you should definitely mention your code of conduct in the details of how to contribute to your project, and you should include how your software is licensed in your installation and use section. Anything else is up to you!\n",

    "\n",
    "## ``CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md``\n",
    "\n",
    "Same deal as the license, although writing a code of conduct is a decidedly less boring process. You can either research and choose an existing CoC or roll your own; be able to justify and talk about why you made the choices you made, and think about who you want to encourage and discourage from participating in your (fake) open-source project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Miscellany\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: You should include, either in a separate text file or in your ``README``, a description of why you went with the license and code of conduct you did. If you made your own of either, talk about what you considered in the writing of it. No more than a few sentences, but be clear and concise in your justification.\n",

    "## Submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write all of your Markdown on Jupyter Hub if you want, but be sure you create the three files separately. This will mean you copy and paste them into files with the extension `.md`. \n",
