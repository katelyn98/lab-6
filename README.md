# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.


## Plaintext and FOSS :fox_face:

Last week, we all learned how to use GitHub. This week, we will be learning about aspects of software that go hand in hand with GitHub. That is, how do people know what to do with open-source projects? If someone visited the repo that you made last week, how would they _know what it does_ or _how to contribute to it_? You'll know the answer to both these questions _and more_ by the end of today. Then, you'll apply that knowledge to the repo you made and submit it by next week.

There are a lot of readings for this week, and they're all in the lecture notebook. Check them out!

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Plaintext-and-FOSS.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Plaintext-and-FOSS`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Exercises.ipynb` notebook. You can also launch `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` if you need a refresher on what the UTA went over in the skills lab.

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Completing the Lab

For the second week in a row, you don't need to fill out a Jupyter notebook. Instead you'll be adding more content to the github repository that you created last week. One again, you'll submit a link to the repository and we will verify that all of you contributed to the work.

This lab and the previous one are meant to teach you how to use git and github to collaborate on software engineering projects. You cannot practice collaboration if you are working alone. You must work on this week's skills lab in a group. You should have completed last week's lab in a group, and you should work in the same group this week. You will not receive any credit for this skills lab if you attempt to complete it on your own. If you did not work in a group last time then it will be too late to join a group this week, and you will not be able to receive any credit.

The group that you formed last time, and that you are continuing to use this week, should include two or three people.

## Submitting your lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you submit your repository. You should take the following steps:
1. You should have already joined a group on Canvas to submit last week's lab. But if you did not join a group on Canvas, then do that first. Here are [instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-join-a-group-as-a-student/ta-p/468) for how to join a group. Make sure you join one of the groups called "Version Control skills lab group X".
2. Your repository should have been made public last week. However if you did not make it public, or if you made it private between now and then, make sure your repository is public. Here are [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) for how to make it public. If your repository is private then we can't see your team's commits and you will temporarily receive a 0.
3. One and only one of you needs to submit a url to the repository page. If you joined a group correctly, one submission will count for all of you.
4. We will look at the commit history and give credit to all group members who contributed. Additionally we will not give any credit if the repository only has one contributor.
